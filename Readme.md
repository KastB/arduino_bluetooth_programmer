# Overview
This project provides a schematic, a helper program and a script to program an Arduino via bluetooth.
THe schematic describes how the bluetooth-chip (HC-05) is connected to the power, serial port and reset pin.
The program resets the Arduino by connecting to the serial port of the bluetooth device.
The script adds some delay before flashing is started as the reset procedure takes more time compared to the wired one.

# Compile reset program

gcc -Wall arduino_reset.cc -o arduino_reset
